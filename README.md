## Objective 
To develop a comprehensive Java-based hospital management system that efficiently handles multiple aspects of hospital operations. The system includes modules for patient registration, appointment scheduling, electronic health records (EHR), billing and invoicing, inventory management for medical supplies, and staff management. 

##  Key Modules and Features 

1. **Patient Registration**:
   - **Functionality**: Register new patients with personal details such as name, address, and contact information.
   - **Data**: Store patient information in a structured format for easy retrieval and updates.
   - **Features**: Add, view, and update patient details.

2. **Appointment Scheduling**:
   - **Functionality**: Schedule, manage, and view appointments between patients and doctors.
   - **Data**: Track appointment details like date, time, patient ID, doctor ID, and reason for the visit.
   - **Features**: Book new appointments, reschedule or cancel existing appointments, and view appointment history.

3. **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**:
   - **Functionality**: Maintain comprehensive health records for each patient.
   - **Data**: Include medical history, treatment records, and other relevant health information.
   - **Features**: Add new records, view patient health histories, and update existing records.

4. **Billing and Invoicing**:
   - **Functionality**: Generate and manage bills and invoices for services rendered.
   - **Data**: Track billing details such as patient ID, bill ID, amount, and date of issue.
   - **Features**: Create new bills, view and update billing records, and track payment status.

5. **Inventory Management**:
   - **Functionality**: Manage medical supplies and equipment inventory.
   - **Data**: Store details of inventory items including item ID, name, and quantity.
   - **Features**: Add new items, update stock quantities, and view current inventory levels.

6. **Staff Management**:
   - **Functionality**: Handle staff details including doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel.
   - **Data**: Maintain records of staff ID, name, role, and contact information.
   - **Features**: Add new staff members, view and update staff details, and manage roles and responsibilities.

## System Design and Architecture 

1. **Data Persistence**:
   - Use serialization or a file-based approach for data storage.
   - Optionally, integrate with a database for more robust data management.

2. **User Interface**:
   - **Console-Based Interface**: Provides a text-based interface for interaction.
   - **Future Enhancement**: Consider implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) or web-based interface for better usability.

3. **Class Structure**:
   - **Patient**: Manages patient information and appointments.
   - **Appointment**: Represents an appointment with date, doctor, and reason.
   - **EHR**: Stores electronic health records for patients.
   - **Bill**: Handles billing details for services rendered.
   - **InventoryItem**: Manages medical supplies and equipment.
   - **Staff**: Represents hospital staff members.

4. **Main Application Class**:
   - Provides the main entry point for the application.
   - Contains methods for interacting with each module.
   - Includes menus for user navigation and performs various operations based on user input.
## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL for data storage and management.
   - Implement CRUD operations using SQL queries.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Develop a user-friendly GUI using JavaFX or Swing for better user interaction.

3. **Security Features**:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization to secure sensitive data.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Design the system to handle a larger number of patients, appointments, and inventory items efficiently.

This overview provides a structured approach to developing a hospital management system. The design ensures that all essential aspects of hospital operations are covered and can be extended or enhanced based on specific requirements.
